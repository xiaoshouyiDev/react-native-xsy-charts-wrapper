# React Native Charts Wrapper
This library is React Native wrapper of popular Native charting library [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) and [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts)


## Introduction

Inspired by [react-native-mp-android-chart](https://github.com/mskec/react-native-mp-android-chart) and [react-native-ios-charts](https://github.com/Jpadilla1/react-native-ios-charts)

React Native Charts Wrapper is built on MPAndroidChart(v3.0.2) & Charts(v3.0.3), support both android & ios.

## Supported Chart Type

* Bar(Stack,Group)
* Line
* Scatter
* Bubble
* Pie
* Radar
* Combined
* CandleStick

## Setup

A step by step tutorial to set up a new project can be found [here](https://github.com/wuxudong/react-native-charts-wrapper/blob/master/Example/README.md)



Library can be easily installed using NPM:

`npm install --save react-native-charts-wrapper`

Additional setup is required because library is using native code.


### ANDROID  


#### 1. Add Maven Repository


**android/build.gradle**

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...

        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }    // used for MPAndroidChart
    }
}
```


#### 2. Add Maven Dependency


*   **Mostly automatic install with react-native**

		react-native link react-native-charts-wrapper
		
*   **Manual install**


**android/settings.gradle**
```
include ':react-native-charts-wrapper'
project(':react-native-charts-wrapper').projectDir = new File(
  rootProject.projectDir,
  '../node_modules/react-native-charts-wrapper/android'
)
```

**android/app/build.gradle**

```
dependencies {
    ...
    compile project(':react-native-charts-wrapper')
}
```

**MainApplication.java**

On top where imports are:

```java
import com.github.wuxudong.rncharts.MPAndroidChartPackage;
```

Add package in `getPackages` method:

```java
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
        new MainReactPackage(),
        new MPAndroidChartPackage()             // <----- Add this
    );
}
```


### IOS

#### 1. Add Source Files

 create a group under your project *top level* and add files under directory node_modules/react-native-charts-wrapper/ios/ReactNativeCharts

#### 2. Add Bridge File

 When you add the files XCode should prompt you to create a bridging header if you haven't done so already, or you can create empty swift file to trigger xcode prompt.
 Create the bridging header and import the RCTViewManager.h. It should look something like this.

		#import "React/RCTBridge.h"
		#import "React/RCTViewManager.h"
		#import "React/RCTUIManager.h"
		#import "React/UIView+React.h"
		#import "React/RCTBridgeModule.h"
		#import "React/RCTEventDispatcher.h"
		#import "React/RCTEventEmitter.h"


You should make sure set this file in your target -> Build Settings -> Swift Compiler - General -> Object-C Bridging Header 


#### 3. Add Charts and SwiftyJSON

*  **Mostly automatic install**


add a `Podfile` to your ios directory with the following content. Then run `pod install` and open the generated .xcworkspace from now on in xcode.

  ```
  use_frameworks!

  target 'MyApp' do
    pod 'SwiftyJSON', '3.1.4'
    pod 'Charts', '3.0.3'
  end
  
  post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '3.0'
      end
    end
  end
  ```
  
*  **Manual install**

1. Install [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) and [iOS Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts) libraries and add `SwiftyJSON.xcodeproj` and `Charts.xcodeproj` files to your project.
2. Under `Build Phases`, under `Link Binary With Libraries`, click the plus sign and add `SwiftyJSON.framework` and `Charts.framework`.
3. Add the `SwiftyJSON.framework` and `Charts.framework` to the `Embedded Binaries` section in your app.
4. In your project's build settings, go to build options and change the `Embedded Content Contains Swift Code` to `Yes`.

## Usage
There are 8 supported charts with many configuration options.
Almost all configuration available in base MPAndroidChart library are available through this wrapper.
More details on available configuration can be found on their [wiki](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki).

Example of how charts are used and how to apply configuration can be found in example.



## Convention

Android and IOS have different convention:

1. color's alpha in android is 0-255, in ios is 0-1
2. percent in android is 0-100, in ios is 0-1
3. animation.duration in MpAndroidChart is milliseconds, in Charts is seconds.
4. their enum case name is always different, for example XAxisPosition, in MpAndroidChart is BOTH_SIDED, in Charts is bothSided.

**Here we use android Convention**

**Always use processColor to set color**



## Data Format

- Complete Form


		data : {
			...
			dataSets: [
				{
					values: [
						{x: 5, y: 90},
						{x: 10, y: 130},
						{x: 50, y: 2000, marker: "eat more"},
						{x: 80, y: 9000, marker: "eat less"}
					]
				},
				...
			]
		}

marker is optional,  if x is omitted, index will be used.

- Simplified Form

	    data: {
			...
	        dataSets: [
	        	{
	          		values: [5, 40, 77, 81, 43]
	          	},
	          	....
	        ]
	    }

index will used as x.

## Callback

**Support value selection callBack.**

you can do whatever you want, even pop your own modal, or jump to another page.

**Support gesture callBack.**

check Example->MultipleChart for details.

## Direct Function Call

Support direct function call.

You can use `chart.moveViewToX(...)` or other functions directly.

check Example->MovingWindowChart for details.


## Custom Marker Content 

Support custom marker content. 

check Example->TimeSeriesLineChart for details.

## Notice

**Several settings are removed.**

1. fontFamily & fontStyle

 Â The font is a little different in android & ios, I don't know how to configure it in js in the same way.
  
**size of chart**

you can set chart to fixed width & height, or flex:1
  
## Need for help

I spent serveral days to learn swift and ios, but I am still quite new to it.

It is not quite elegant to copy source files to your project, but I haven't figure out how to build it as a framework like others.

Here is the [question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42570599/how-to-create-react-native-framework-using-swift) in stackoverflow. 

It is appreciated if you can answer the question or create a issue/PR.
